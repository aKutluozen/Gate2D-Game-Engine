# JS-Game-Boilerplate

A basic JavaScript game framework utilizing canvas features of HTML5.

This is an ongoing side project of mine in which I bring together some of the functions I use the most when I create basic 2D games.

# Basic Workflow:

1. Create your objects with their own methods in custom_objects file. (inherit from Entity.js if need be)
2. Load them and any other necessary assets in Bootstrap.js
3. Instantiate game objects, variables, and levels in GameEntities.js
4. Write your main game logic in GameUpdate.js
5. Write your main game draw calls in GameDraw.js
6. Run the game!

A much more detailed documentation will come soon!
