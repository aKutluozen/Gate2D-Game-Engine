Gate2D is an HTML5 Canvas based game engine written in JavaScript. It provides developers with a useful set of tools for graphics, level management, object pooling, math and physics calculations, and many more. Gate2D helps set up a project structure and build playable games in matter of minutes.

# Basic Workflow of the Engine:

1. Custom game objects must be created in assets/objects folder as .js files.
2. All the custom assets (objects, images, sounds, scripts, etc.) must be declared in the setup.js file.
3. Once they are declared, fine tuning of the engine must be also done in setup.js using loadAll function.
4. Global variables and level configurations should be done in entities.js.
5. Any extra draw or update calls can be added to update.js or draw.js.

A much more detailed documentation will come soon. For now, just follow the example games I've created for you!
